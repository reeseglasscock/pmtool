## Project: Basecamp Clone
### Project Goal: To create a collaborative space for projects (managers and users)

#### MVP:
* I want the user to be able to add a project.
* I want the user to be able to have others users added to their project. 
* I want users to be able to update status of projects including milestones, etc.
* I want users to be able to add users that are not in the app and have an email generated and mailed to the new user. 

#### Tools:
* Ruby on Rails
* API? - I donâ€™t know what API I would use. I think at most that I will be looking at gems to use. 

#### Additional Features:
* I want to be able to create something that will give reminders for those using the app that they have things that are coming soon. 
* I want to be able to create additional user roles beyond that of users: Project Managers, etc. so that the application can have some kind of management behind the projects. 
* Creating approval systems or workflows. 
* Some way to export reports from the app to visually show a projects progress. 
* Add devise security extension for user security and captcha support.
* Pinning projects to the top
* Chatroom
* Teams
* Headquarters section for the whole 'company'
* Add translator to turn text into different languages for users
* Add ajax to close out the flash messages that appear

#### Additional Technologies:
* I will need to look at the way to generate PDF's or reports from data and make them so they are visually pleasing. 
* I think that looking at creating email templates will also be important if things want to be shared.
